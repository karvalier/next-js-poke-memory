## Introduction:
Welcome to the Pokémon Memory Game! This project is a fun memory game based on the popular Pokémon characters. Test your ability to remember and match Pokémon cards in this challenging game.

The game offers various levels of complexity to suit players of different ages and skills. Whether you're a beginner or a memory master, you'll find a challenge that fits your level.

This game has been developed using Next.js, a powerful React framework that enables the creation of fast and scalable web applications. We have also utilized Tailwind CSS for UI design and styling, allowing us to create an attractive and responsive layout.

The Pokémon data used in the game is obtained from the public Pokémon API (https://pokeapi.co/), which provides detailed information about each Pokémon, such as their name and images. This integration with the API allows us to offer a wide variety of Pokémon for players to enjoy and discover while playing.

Get ready to immerse yourself in the world of Pokémon and enjoy this exciting memory game! Have fun, improve your memory skills, and strive for the highest score. Let the Pokémon adventure begin!
